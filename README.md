The  Project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in Java along with exception handling, modular programming, and test-driven validation of input data. The main purpose of the project is to take an array of student objects, validate each student for correctness, and then calculate the grades based on their marks. The project is organized into four different packages, each serving a unique purpose and following clean separation of concerns. The first package, *com.mile1.bean*, defines the blueprint of the Student class. This class contains three primary attributes: the name of the student, the marks array holding subject marks, and the grade which is calculated later. To ensure flexibility, the Student class provides both default and parameterized constructors along with public getters and setters, adhering to encapsulation principles. The second package, *com.mile1.exception*, contains user-defined exceptions to handle different invalid cases. These include NullNameException when the student’s name is missing, NullMarksArrayException when the marks array is not provided, and NullStudentObjectException when the student object itself is null. Each of these exception classes extends the Java Exception class and overrides the toString() method to return meaningful error messages such as “name is null,” “mark array is null,” or “object is null.” The third package, *com.mile1.service*, includes the logic classes StudentService and StudentReport. The StudentService class provides methods to count invalid objects in the student array, such as findNumberOfNullMarksArray() to detect students without marks, findNumberOfNullName() to count students without names, and findNumberOfNullObjects() to find null references in the array. These methods carefully check each student object to avoid NullPointerException and return the latest count values. The StudentReport class, on the other hand, is responsible for grade computation and validation. The findGrades() method applies the grading rules: if any mark is below 35, the student is graded “F.” Otherwise, the sum of all marks determines the grade—less than 150 results in “C,” less than 200 results in “B,” less than 250 results in “A,” and 250 or above results in “A+.” The validate() method ensures that only correct data objects are processed, throwing appropriate exceptions if any field is invalid, or returning “VALID” if everything is correct. The final package, *com.mile1.main*, drives the program through the StudentMain class. This class creates an array of student objects, deliberately including valid and invalid entries to test both successful and failure cases. Inside the main() method, each student is validated, exceptions are caught and displayed, and valid students’ grades are calculated and printed. Additionally, the program calls methods from StudentService to report the total number of null names, null marks, and null objects in the dataset. This ensures comprehensive testing of edge cases and robustness of the system. Overall, this project serves as an excellent demonstration of Java fundamentals, exception handling, modular design, and test case-driven development. It not only calculates grades but also highlights the importance of validation in real-world applications where data may often be incomplete or incorrect.
